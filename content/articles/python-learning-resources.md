# Online Videos

The [PyVideo](https://pyvideo.org/) site is an index of free videos on Python and related topics.

[Corey Schafer's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g) provides introductory tutorials for getting started with Python and programming.

# Books

The official documentation is provided with many distributions of Python, and you can download the documentation set as an [ebook in PDF or EPUB formats](https://docs.python.org/3/download.html).

There are several excellent books for learning Python 3, and there are three that you can read for free online:

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/), which includes a gentle introduction to programming, before explaining specific projects
- [How to Code in Python](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-ebook-how-to-code-in-python) offers more detailed tutorials for learners 
- [Dive Into Python 3](https://www.diveinto.org/python3/) provides a quick start for those people with some previous experience of programming

If you are teaching children, buy a copy of [Teach Your Kids to Code](https://nostarch.com/teachkids) by Bryson Payne.

# Courses

There too many to list!

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) provides a complete course on the basics of Python. The course is available online at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) and [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-for-everybody-getting-started-with-python). The textbook and course material are available for free. This course is also designed to be taught by other educators and trainers, so the materials include assessment autograders and integrations for learning management systems. 

# Online Guides

Once you have learned Python itself, visit [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org), which provides clear advice on daily work with Python, and [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com) for a comprehensive guide to building Web applications with Python.

If you are a programmer or systems administrator, consider [replacing bash scripting with Python](https://github.com/ninjaaron/replacing-bash-scripting-with-python).

[This article](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/python-toolbox) lists useful tools and libraries for Python.

# Podcasts

[Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a weekly news show for Python, with episodes that are about 15 minutes long.

[Podcast.__init__](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/) and [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) both run interviews with software project leaders and key community members. Episodes are usually just over 60 minutes long. 

# Beyond the Basics

After you have worked with Python for a while, buy a copy of [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/). This book will enable you to write idiomatic and efficient code.

If you use Python for data science or other demanding applications, read [High Performance Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781449361747/).
