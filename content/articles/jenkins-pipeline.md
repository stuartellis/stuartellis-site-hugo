The [Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) plugin for the  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) Continuous Integration system enables you to store job  configurations as files within your source code repositories, rather than entering them directly into the Web interface. Version 2 of Jenkins includes Pipeline as standard, and this is now the recommended way to set up your Jenkins jobs.

# Overview #

Version 2 of Jenkins includes the [Pipeline](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin) plugin by default, but you can install the plugin into a Jenkins 1 system as well. In either case, it behaves the same.
