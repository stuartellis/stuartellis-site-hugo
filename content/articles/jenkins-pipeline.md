The [Pipeline Plugin](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) for the
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) Continuous Integration system enables you to
define jobs in code, and store them as files within your source code
repositories. Version 2 of Jenkins includes Pipeline as standard, and it is easy
to add Docker support.

# Overview #

Jenkins uses the [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) scripting language for
defining jobs with Pipeline, but you can write scripts without learning the
details of Groovy. Your job code can call functions from any Jenkins plugin that supports Pipeline.

In most cases, you put the script in a file (called
*Jenkinsfile* by default), and add this to the version control repository for
your project. This means that each job only need a minimal configuration on the
Jenkins server, which specifies the Jenkinsfile.

You can also write Pipeline scripts directly into the Web interface of Jenkins, but
should only use this feature for development and testing.

# Installation #

To integrate Docker with Pipeline, install Docker on the Jenkins server and add
the [CloudBees Docker Pipeline
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Pipeline+Plugin)
to the Jenkins installation. Check the [compatibility
list](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md)
for the status of other plugins. You do have to ensure that all of the plugins
that you reference are installed on every Jenkins instance that you use for that
job.

If you maintain Jenkins version 1 systems you will need to install the Pipeline Plugin
through the usual process. It is automatically included in all new installations
of Jenkins 2.

# Writing A Pipeline Script #

Create a file in the version control repository for your project. Set the name
of the file as *Jenkinsfile* unless you need to have multiple build
scripts in your repository.

Each file defines a *node*, which represents the instance on which the steps
will run. Within the node, write a series of *steps*. You define a step like
this:

~~~groovy
step("Step name") {
  // commands to run
}
~~~

You automatically have access to the features of the Groovy scripting language, and the built-in *env* object gives you access to environment variables.
Jenkins plugins provide extra objects that you may use within the script, such
as *docker*. Avoid putting complex commands directly in your Jenkins scripts,
though. Write any commands that require multiple options or other logic as
separate scripts in an appropriate language, such as UNIX shell or PowerShell,
and call them from your Jenkins build script.

# Using Docker Containers #

The *docker* object enables you to run containers from images in Docker
repositories, and execute commands within the containers. To run steps inside a
container, rather than the host system, declare the steps within an *inside() {}*
block. If you specify an image name for a container without a repository
address, the image is downloaded from the *Docker Hub*.

The contents of the workspace are automatically shared with the container. This
means that commands will run as you would expect, and post-build steps like
*archive* will work correctly without any changes.

For example, this snippet starts a container from the *ruby* image tagged
*2.3.1* and runs two steps that execute shell commands within the container:

~~~groovy
docker.image('ruby:2.3.1').inside {

    stage("Install Bundler") {
      sh "gem install bundler --no-rdoc --no-ri"
    }

    stage("Use Bundler to install dependencies") {
      sh "bundle install"
    }
}
~~~

You may use multiple containers in a single Jenkins job.

# Using Stored Credentials #

Jenkins 2 includes the [Credentials Binding Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Binding+Plugin), so that you can access stored credentials within your Pipeline scripts.

Create a *withCredentials() {}* block to retrieve a credential and make it available as an environment variable within the block:

~~~groovy
withCredentials([
    [$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'cred1', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME1', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD1'],
    [$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'cred2', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME2', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD2']
  ]) {
  sh 'echo $PASSWORD1'
  echo "${env.USERNAME2}"
}
~~~

# An Example Pipeline Script #

Here is a longer example script:

~~~groovy
node {
        stage("Main build") {

            checkout scm

            docker.image('ruby:2.3.1').inside {

              stage("Install Bundler") {
                sh "gem install bundler --no-rdoc --no-ri"
              }

              stage("Use Bundler to install dependencies") {
                sh "bundle install"
              }

              stage("Build package") {
                sh "bundle exec rake build:deb"
              }

              stage("Archive package") {
                archive (includes: 'pkg/*.deb')
              }

           }

        }

        // Clean up workspace
        step([$class: 'WsCleanup'])

}
~~~

# Creating a Job for Running a Pipeline Script #

First, define the credentials for the Jenkins CI server to access your source
control system in the Web interface using *Manage Jenkins > Credentials*. For
example, an SSH key for access to Git repositories.

Create a new job in the Jenkins Web interface, selecting the *Pipeline* type. In
the *Pipeline* section of the job settings, set the *Definition* to *Pipeline
script from SCM*, the *SCM* to *Git*, then enter the *Repository URL* and
specify the set of *Credentials*. You do not need to add any other settings.

# Tutorials #

The [tutorial for Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/) explains how to install and use it. Similarly, the [Docker Pipeline Plugin](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-documentation/cje-user-guide/chapter-docker-workflow.html) is well-documented.

Once you have written a Pipeline script, check it against the [article on Top 10 Best Practices](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/top-10-best-practices-jenkins-pipeline-plugin).
