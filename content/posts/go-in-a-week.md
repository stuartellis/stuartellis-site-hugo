The consensus is that Go has is easy to learn. I have a limited (but not non-existent) amount of time. So I asked myself the question: if I *had* to learn Go in a week, how would that work?

I actually started learning Go before this.

I've been reading [Secrets of Productive People, by Mark
Forster](http://markforster.squarespace.com/), a book which is full of incredibly practical advice (despite the sensationalist title), and one of the ideas that Forster promotes seemed extremely relevant: keep ask questions.

# Questions!

* How do I learn Go in a week?
* What does "learn" mean here?
* Exactly how long is a "a week"?
* What do I learn before anything else?
* What concepts are essential to be able to read Go code?
* What concepts are important to be able to write Go code?
* What do I do afterwards?

# How?

* One lesson tutorial
